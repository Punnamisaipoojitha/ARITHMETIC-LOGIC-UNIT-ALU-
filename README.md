*DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK* :

This project involves the design and simulation of a basic 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using Verilog Hardware Description Language (HDL). The ALU is a key component of any digital processing system and is responsible for carrying out both arithmetic and logical operations. As part of the internship at CodTech, the objective is to implement a simple yet functional ALU capable of performing five primary operations: addition, subtraction, bitwise AND, bitwise OR, and bitwise NOT.

The ALU takes two 4-bit inputs, labeled A and B, and a 3-bit control input called opcode that determines which operation to perform. Depending on the opcode value, the ALU computes and outputs the result of the selected operation. Specifically, when the opcode is 000, the ALU performs addition (A + B); when it is 001, it performs subtraction (A - B); when set to 010, it computes the bitwise AND of A and B; opcode 011 results in a bitwise OR; and finally, opcode 100 applies a bitwise NOT to operand A, ignoring B.

The implementation is carried out using Verilog. The design includes two primary files: the ALU module (ALU.v) and its corresponding testbench (ALU_tb.v). The testbench simulates various inputs and opcodes to verify the correctness of each operation. Simulated results are observed using waveform analysis or console outputs. For instance, the addition of A = 0011 and B = 0001 with opcode 000 produces the result 0100.

A comprehensive simulation report is generated that outlines the test cases and confirms that the ALU performs as expected. The final deliverables include the ALU source code, testbench file, simulation output, and a report describing the implementation process. This project serves as a foundational exercise in digital design, showcasing the studentâ€™s ability to use Verilog to create and simulate combinational logic modules.
